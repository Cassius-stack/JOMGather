Problem Statement
Bridging Intergenerational Interaction in Singapore

Background

In Singapore’s fast-paced society, interaction between youth and seniors has become increasingly limited. Many young people are focused on school or work, while seniors may feel disconnected from younger generations due to differences in communication styles, technology use, and social interests. Initiatives such as Youth Corps Singapore’s intergenerational programs, Lions Befrienders’ digital buddy schemes, and school community service projects have shown positive impact — but these efforts are often short-term and in-person, leaving gaps for continuous connection after events end. With the rise of digital communication, there is a unique opportunity to use web technology to create a sustained digital bridge between generations — one that promotes understanding, storytelling, and mutual learning in a fun, meaningful way.

Problem Statement

Intergenerational connections in Singapore are weakening due to a lack of sustained, meaningful interaction between youth and seniors. This contributes to loneliness among seniors and reduced empathy and cultural understanding among younger generations.

How might we design a web-based platform that encourages ongoing, meaningful interactions between seniors and youth — through shared experiences, digital storytelling, or collaborative activities — in a way that is accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable?

Each team can come up with the basic features such as, but not limited to: 
• Story/Memory Sharing Management
• Activity/Event Management 
• Messaging/Communication Management 
• Profile Management (Youth/Senior) 
• Community/Group Management

1. Onboarding & User Profiles
Target Users: Elderly & Students/Youth.
Sign-Up Form:
Social Profile Setup: Users input demographics and interests.
Availability: Users set their "Peak Hours" for interaction.
Goal: Gather data to facilitate accurate algorithmic matching.

2. Pairing Ecosystem
There are two distinct modes for connecting users.
Pairing Mode
Target Audience
Mechanism
Random Search
Isolated individuals looking for connection.
• Algorithm: Matches Student & Elderly based on social profile & interests, similar to LinkedIn or Facebook.

• Trial: A specific "Trial Session" to evaluate compatibility.

• Decision: Users vote to Confirm Pair or Find New.
Friend Search
Existing Grandparent-Grandchild pairs.
• Search Bar: Find specific users by name.

• Direct Pairing: Connect instantly via Friend List.


3. Core Interactions & Activities
These features are designed to facilitate bonding between the pairs.
📖 The "Slice of Life" (Signature Feature) (Cassius) 
A collaborative storytelling feature designed to bridge the generational gap.
How it works: Both the elderly and the youth are given the same prompt image. They describe it based on their own unique life experiences.
The Output: Once both sides submit, it combines into a "Display"—a shared story contrasting or harmonizing two generations.
The Catalog: Displays are uploaded to a public or private feed.
Engagement: Users can read stories from other pairs and "Like" them.
Convenience: Designed as a low-friction, 5-minute task (e.g., doable on a bus ride home).
🎮 Activity Suite (Brandon)
TikTok Challenges: Quick, virtual video challenges following current trends.
Puzzle Challenges: Cooperative brain games.
Virtual Games: Casual games played within the app.
Daily Photo Streak: Grandparents and students exchange a photo a day to maintain a streak.



🗣️ Social & Community Features (Zongrong)   
AskAGrandfriend: A forum where elderly users post problems or questions, and students help answer them. Great for establishing new connections outside of the main pair.
BOOMERang: A "Quick Call" feature allowing users to jump into brief voice/video chats with elderly users for instant interaction.
Interest Communities: Users can join specific interest groups to expand their social circle beyond their pair.
(ZR) Physical Assistance
🏪 Skills Marketplace (Akil)
Skill Assignment: Both students and elderlies can choose on their profile the skills they posses (digital literacy, knitting, etc)
Skill Library: When both have selected their skills: algorithm can show recommended skills to match based on user preference (age range, skill types, etc)
Skill Match: When A requests B to match, B has a choice to accept or decline, and when accepted, algorithm chooses a date for both of them to meet up to carry out activity
Skill Reward: When the activity exchange has been carried out, both elderly and student can end the session and earn badges and points

4. Gamification & Rewards
A system designed to retain users and incentivize interaction.
🏆 The Leaderboard System (Promote Competition)
Earning Points:
Completing meetups (virtual or physical).
Finishing "Slice of Life" displays.
Maintaining streaks (Daily Photo/Login).
Winning Tik Tok/Puzzle challenges.
Rewards (Incentive): 
Vouchers: Redeem points for real-world items or discounts.
Weekly Fame: "Most Loved Stories" from the Slice of Life catalog featured weekly.
🎓 Student Incentives
Certificate of Participation: Awarded to students who reach a minimum point threshold, serving as a volunteer/extracurricular credential to attract more youth sign-ups.
🏡 "Support Swaps" (Micro-Assistance Requests)
This feature expands on Zongrong's idea of Physical Assistance and Akil's Skills Marketplace by turning small, non-skill-based chores or errands into low-friction, high-impact bonding opportunities for the paired users.
Core Concept: A dedicated, hyper-localized system for the elder to request minor, non-expert physical assistance from their paired student, making the student a reliable support mechanism.
How it Works:
The Request: The elder can quickly post a pre-set "Micro-Assistance Request" to their student's private feed. These are limited to simple tasks that require only time and presence, not specialized skills:
"Help me organize these photos/books."
"Pick up a library book on your way over."
"Help me change a lightbulb or set up a new device."
"Walk my pet/water my plants for 15 minutes."
The Acceptance: The student receives a notification and can accept or decline. If accepted, the app suggests a meeting time (integrating with a calendar tool if available).
Reciprocity Log: These completed tasks are logged. For every five Support Swaps completed by the student, the elder is prompted to offer a "Legacy Gift"—a tangible item or service (e.g., a handwritten recipe, a small homemade craft, or an offer of a Boomerang Quick Call outside of their scheduled time) reinforcing the idea of a two-way exchange.
Safety & Scope: Clearly defined rules ensure tasks are safe, short (under 30 minutes), and do not involve money handling or heavy lifting.
Complementary Value:
It addresses the real, small needs of the elderly population that often go unmet.
It gives the student a powerful sense of purpose and utility, reinforcing the value of their time and physical presence.
It grounds the digital relationship in tangible, helpful real-world interaction, complementing the digital focus of the Activity Suite and Slice of Life.


5. Additional Services
(ZR) Physical Assistance: A feature allowing elderly users to request physical help (errands, tech support) from matched students.
