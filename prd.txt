## Problem Statement

### Background
In Singapore's fast-paced society, interaction between youth and seniors has become increasingly limited. Many young people are focused on school or work, while seniors may feel disconnected from younger generations due to differences in communication styles, technology use, and social interests.

### Challenge
Intergenerational connections in Singapore are weakening due to a lack of sustained, meaningful interaction between youth and seniors. This contributes to loneliness among seniors and reduced empathy and cultural understanding among younger generations.

### Solution
How might we design a web-based platform that encourages ongoing, meaningful interactions between seniors and youth — through shared experiences, digital storytelling, or collaborative activities — in a way that is accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable?
